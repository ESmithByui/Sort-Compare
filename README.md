## Overview

**Project Title**:
Sort Comparer

**Project Description**:
It generates random lists that the program can then sort through using merge, quick, and bubble sort. It then displays the average amount of comparisons and time.

**Project Goals**:
The goal was to learn typescript and by extension javascript.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure you can run javascript on your computer.
2. If you only have the typescript file, use tsc .\sort_comp.ts to compile to javascript.
3. Open up a terminal to run node .\sort_comp.js
4. If there are other ways you have to run the file, you can use those.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run sort_comp.js using node .\sort_comp.js
2. Enter in the length of the lists to be used.
3. Enter the minimum and maximum random numbers in the list.
4. Enter the amount of lists to be compared.
5. Wait for the comparison to finish.
